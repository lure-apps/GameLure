{{Enforcement policy list}}
{{Padlock list}}
In some circumstances, pages may need to be '''protected''' from modification by certain groups of editors. Pages are protected when a specific damaging event has been identified that can not be prevented through other means such as a [[WP:Blocking policy|block]]. Otherwise, Wikipedia is built on the principle that [[wiki|anyone can edit it]], and it therefore aims to have as many of its pages as possible open for public editing so that anyone can add material and correct errors. This policy explains in detail the protection types and procedures for page protection and unprotection and when each protection should and should not be applied.

Protection is a technical restriction applied only by [[Wikipedia:Administrators|administrators]], although any user may [[WP:Requests for page protection|request protection]]. Protection can be [[Wikipedia:List of indefinitely protected pages|indefinite]] or expire after a specified time. The various levels of protection are detailed below, and they can be applied to the page edit, page move, page create, and file upload actions. Even when a page is protected from editing, the [[source code]] (text) of the page can still be viewed and copied by any user.

A protected page is marked at its top right by a padlock icon, usually added by the {{tlx|pp-protected}} template.

== Types of protection ==
{{Policy shortcut|WP:PPLIST}}

The following technical options are available to administrators for protecting different actions to pages:
*'''Edit protection''' protects the page from being [[Help:Editing|edited]].
*'''Move protection''' protects the page from being [[Help:Moving a page|moved or renamed]].
*'''Creation protection''' prevents a page (normally a previously [[Wikipedia:Deletion policy|deleted]] one) from being created (also known as "[[Wikipedia:Salt|salting]]").
*'''Upload protection''' prevents new versions of a file from being [[Help:upload|uploaded]], but it does not prevent editing to the file's description page (unless edit protection is applied).

The following technical options are available to administrators for adding protection levels to the different actions to pages:
*'''Pending changes protection''' ''(only available for edit protection)'' means edits by unregistered and new contributors are not visible to readers who are not logged-in until the edits are approved by a [[Wikipedia:User access levels#Reviewer|reviewer]] or an administrator.
*'''Semi-protection''' prevents the action by unregistered contributors and contributors with accounts that are not [[Wikipedia:User access levels#Autoconfirmed users|confirmed]].
*'''Extended confirmed protection''', also known as '''30/500 protection''', prevents the action by users without 30 days' tenure and 500 edits on the English Wikipedia. It is applied to combat any form of disruption where semi-protection has proven to be ineffective. It should not be applied as a protection level of first resort. Its use is logged at the [[WP:AN|Administrators' noticeboard]].
*'''Template protection''' prevents the action by everyone except [[Wikipedia:Template editor|template editors]] and [[Wikipedia:Administrators|administrators]] (who have this right as part of their toolset).
*'''Full protection''' prevents the action by everyone except [[Wikipedia:Administrators|administrators]].

Any type of protection (with the exception of [[#Cascading protection|cascading protection]]) may be requested at [[Wikipedia:Requests for page protection]]. Changes to a fully protected page should be proposed on the corresponding [[WP:Talk page|talk page]], then carried out by an administrator if they are uncontroversial or there is [[Wikipedia:Consensus|consensus]] for them.

{{anchor|RemovingProtection}}Except in the case of [[Wikipedia:Office actions|office actions]] (see [[#Office actions|below]]), [[Wikipedia:AC|Arbitration Committee]] remedies, or pages in the MediaWiki namespace (see below), administrators may unprotect a page if the reason for its protection no longer applies, a reasonable period has elapsed, and there is no consensus that continued protection is necessary. Editors desiring the unprotection of a page should, in the first instance, ask the administrator who applied the protection unless the administrator is inactive or no longer an administrator; thereafter, requests may be made at [[WP:RFUP|Requests for unprotection]]. Note that such requests will normally be declined if the protecting administrator is active and was not consulted first. A log of protections and unprotections is available at [[Special:Log/protect]].

=== Full protection ===
[[File:Full-protection-shackle.svg|64px|upright=0.4|right|alt=Gold padlock|link=]]
{{policy shortcut|WP:FULL|WP:GOLDLOCK}}
A fully protected page cannot be edited or moved by anyone except [[Wikipedia:Administrators|administrators]]. The protection may be for a specified time or may be indefinite.

Modifications to a fully protected page can be proposed on its [[Wikipedia:Talk page guidelines|talk page]] (or at another appropriate forum) for discussion. Administrators can make changes to the protected article reflecting [[Wikipedia:Consensus|consensus]]. Placing the {{tlx|Edit fully protected}} template on the talk page will draw the attention of administrators for implementing uncontroversial changes.

{{anchor|full-dispute}}<!--former tag allows section referencing while accommodating section name changes. DO NOT REMOVE IT.-->
==== Content disputes ====
{{See also|Wikipedia:Stable version}}
{{redirect|WP:PREFER|what title name should be preferred|WP:PRIMARYTOPIC}}
While content disputes and [[Wikipedia:Edit war|edit warring]] may be addressed with user [[Wikipedia:Blocking policy|blocks]] issued by [[WP:UNINVOLVED|uninvolved]] administrators, allowing normal page editing by other editors at the same time, the protection policy provides an alternative approach as administrators have the discretion to temporarily fully protect an article to end an ongoing edit war. This approach may better suit multi-party disputes and contentious content, as it makes talk page [[Wikipedia:Consensus|consensus]] a requirement for implementation of [[Wikipedia:Edit requests|requested edits]].

{{anchor|PREFER|prefer}}<!--former tags allow section referencing while accommodating section name changes. DO NOT REMOVE IT.-->
{{Policy shortcut|WP:PREFER}}
When protecting a page because of a content dispute, administrators have a duty to avoid protecting a version that contains policy-violating content, such as [[WP:Vandalism|vandalism]], [[WP:COPYVIO|copyright violations]], [[WP:Libel|defamation]], or [[WP:BLP|poor-quality coverage of living people]]. Administrators are deemed to remain uninvolved when exercising discretion on whether to apply protection to the current version of an article, or to an older, [[WP:STABLE|stable]], or pre-edit-war version.

Protected pages may not be edited except to make changes that are uncontroversial or for which there is clear consensus. Editors convinced that the protected version of an article contains policy-violating content, or that protection has rewarded edit warring or disruption by establishing a contentious revision, may identify a stable version ''prior to'' the edit war and [[Wikipedia:Edit requests|request]] reversion to that version. Before making such a request, editors should consider how independent editors might view the suggestion and recognize that continuing an edit war is grounds for being blocked.

Administrators who have made substantive content changes to an article are considered [[WP:INVOLVED|involved]] and must not use their advanced permissions to further their own positions. When involved in a dispute, it is almost always wisest to respect the editing policies that bind all editors and call for input from an uninvolved administrator, rather than to invite controversy by acting unilaterally.

==== Vandalism ====
{{Policy shortcut|WP:NO-PREEMPT|WP:PREEMPTIVE}}

Applying page protection as a preemptive measure is contrary to the open nature of Wikipedia and is generally not allowed if applied for these reasons. However, brief periods of an appropriate and reasonable protection level are allowed in situations where blatant vandalism or disruption is occurring by multiple users and at a level of frequency that requires its use in order to stop it. The duration of the protection should be set as short as possible, and the protection level should be set to the lowest restriction needed in order to stop the disruption while still allowing productive editors to make changes.

==== "History only" review ====
{{Policy shortcut|WP:PPDRV}}
If a deleted page is going through [[Wikipedia:Deletion review|deletion review]], only administrators are normally capable of viewing the former content of the page. If they feel it would benefit the discussion to allow other users to view the page content, administrators may [[Wikipedia:Restore|restore]] the page, blank it or replace the contents with {{tlx|Temporarily undeleted}} or a similar notice, and fully protect the page to prevent further editing. The previous contents of the page are then accessible to everyone via the [[Help:Page history|page history]].

==== <span id="Protected generic image names"></span> Protected generic file names ====
Generic file names such as [[:File:Map.jpg]], [[:File:Photo.jpg]], and [[:File:Sound.wav]] are fully protected to prevent new versions being uploaded.

{{Clear}}{{anchor|indef}}<!--former tag allows section referencing while accommodating section name changes. DO NOT REMOVE IT.-->

==== Permanent protection ====
{{anchor|Interface protection}}
[[File:Interface-protection-shackle.svg|64px|upright=0.4|right|alt=Brown padlock|link=|Icon for pages that can be edited only by interface administrators]]
{{Policy shortcut|WP:PPINDEF|WP:PERM-PRO|WP:REDLOCK}}

Administrators cannot change or remove the protection for some areas on Wikipedia which are permanently protected by the [[MediaWiki]] software:
*Edits to the [[Help:MediaWiki namespace|MediaWiki namespace]], which defines parts of the site interface, are restricted to administrators.
**Edits to system-wide CSS and JavaScript pages such as [[MediaWiki:common.js]] are further restricted to [[WP:IADMIN|interface administrators]].
*Edits to personal CSS and JavaScript pages such as [[User:Example/monobook.css]] and [[User:Example/cologneblue.js]] are restricted to the associated user and interface administrators. Interface administrators may edit these pages, for example, to remove a user script that has been used in an inappropriate way. Administrators may delete (but not edit or restore) these pages.
*Edits to personal JSON pages such as [[User:Example/data.json]] are restricted to the associated user and administrators.

In addition to hard-coded protection, the following are usually fully protected for an indefinite period of time:

* Pages that are very visible, such as the [[Main Page]]
* Pages that should not be modified for copyright or legal reasons, such as the [[Wikipedia:General disclaimer|general disclaimer]] or the [[Wikipedia:Text of Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License|local copy of the site copyright license]].
* Pages that are very frequently [[Wikipedia:Transclusion|transcluded]], such as {{tlx|tl}} or {{tlx|citation needed}}, to prevent [[Wikipedia:Vandalism|vandalism]] or [[Denial-of-service attack|denial of service]] attacks. This includes images or templates used in other highly visible or frequently transcluded pages. See [[Wikipedia:High-risk templates]] for more information.

{{anchor|template}}<!--former tags allow section referencing while accommodating section name changes. DO NOT REMOVE IT.-->

=== Template protection ===
{{main|Wikipedia:Template editor}}
[[File:Template-protection-shackle.svg|64px|upright=0.4|right|alt=Pink padlock|link=]]
{{Policy shortcut|WP:TPROT|WP:PINKLOCK}}
A template-protected page can be edited only by administrators or users in the {{int:group-templateeditor}} group. This protection level should be used almost exclusively on [[Wikipedia:High-risk templates|high-risk templates]] and [[WP:LUA|modules]]. In cases where pages in other namespaces become transcluded to a very high degree, this protection level is also valid.

This is a protection level<ref>Created October 2013 as a result of [[Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Template editor user right‎]]</ref> that replaces [[WP:FULL|full protection]] on pages that are merely protected due to high transclusion rates, rather than content disputes. It should be used on templates whose risk factor would have otherwise warranted full protection. It should not be used on less risky templates on the grounds that the [[WP:TPE|template editor]] user right exists—the existence of the right should not result in more templates becoming uneditable for the general editing community.

Editors may request edits to a template-protected page by proposing them on its talk page, using the {{Tlx|Edit template-protected}} template if necessary to gain attention.

{{anchor|semi|semi-user}}<!--former tag allows section referencing while accommodating section name changes. DO NOT REMOVE IT.-->

=== Semi-protection ===
{{See also|Wikipedia:Rough guide to semi-protection}}
[[File:Semi-protection-shackle.svg|64px|upright=0.4|right|alt=Silver padlock|link=]]
{{Policy shortcut|WP:SEMI|WP:SILVERLOCK}}

Semi-protected pages cannot be edited by [[Wikipedia:User access levels#Unregistered users|unregistered users]] ([[IP address]]es), as well as accounts that are not [[Wikipedia:User access levels#Autoconfirmed users|autoconfirmed]] (accounts that are at least four days old and have made at least ten edits to Wikipedia) or [[Wikipedia:User access levels#Confirmed users|confirmed]]. Semi-protection is useful when there is a significant amount of disruption or [[Wikipedia:Vandalism|vandalism]] from new or unregistered users, or to prevent [[Sockpuppet (Internet)|sockpuppets]] of blocked or banned users from editing, especially when it occurs on [[WP:BLP|biographies of living persons]] who have had a recent high level of media interest. An alternative to semi-protection is [[Wikipedia:Pending changes|pending changes]], which is sometimes favored when an article is being vandalized regularly, but otherwise receives a low amount of editing.

Such users can request edits to a semi-protected page by proposing them on its talk page, using the {{Tl|Edit semi-protected}} template if necessary to gain attention. If the page in question and its talk page are ''both'' protected, please make your edit request at [[WP:RFED|Wikipedia:Requests for page protection]] instead. New users may also request the confirmed user right at [[Wikipedia:Requests for permissions/Confirmed]].

==== Guidance for administrators ====
Administrators may apply {{em|indefinite}} semi-protection to pages that are subject to heavy and persistent [[Wikipedia:Vandalism|vandalism]] or violations of [[:Category:Wikipedia content policies|content policy]] (such as [[Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons|biographies of living persons]], [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view|neutral point of view]]). Semi-protection should {{em|not}} be used as a preemptive measure against vandalism that has not yet occurred or to privilege registered users over unregistered users in (valid) content disputes.

In addition, administrators may apply {{em|temporary}} semi-protection on pages that are:
* Subject to significant but temporary vandalism or disruption (for example, due to [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia in the media|media attention]]) if [[Wikipedia:Blocking policy|blocking]] individual users is not a feasible option.
* Subject to [[Wikipedia:Edit warring|edit warring]] if {{em|all}} parties involved are unregistered or new editors (i.e. in cases in which full protection would otherwise be applied). This does {{em|not}} apply when autoconfirmed users are involved.
* Subject to [[Wikipedia:Vandalism|vandalism]] or [[Wikipedia:Edit warring|edit warring]] where unregistered editors are engaging in [[IP address#Dynamic IP|IP hopping]] by using different computers, obtaining new addresses by using [[dynamic IP]] allocation, or other address-changing schemes.
* Article discussion pages, if they have been subject to persistent disruption. Such protection should be used sparingly because it prevents unregistered and newly registered users from participating in discussions. A page and its talk page should not normally be protected at the same time. If a page and its talk page are both protected, the talk page should direct affected editors to [[WP:RFED|Wikipedia:Request for edit]] to ensure that no editor is entirely prevented from contributing.
* Protection should be used sparingly on the talk pages of blocked users, including IP addresses. Instead the user should be re-blocked with talk page editing disallowed. When required, or when re-blocking without talk page editing allowed is unsuccessful, protection should be implemented for only a brief period not exceeding the duration of the block.

[[Wikipedia:Today's featured article|Today's featured article]] may be semi-protected just like any other article. But since that article is subject to sudden spurts of vandalism during certain times of day, administrators should semi-protect it for brief periods in most instances. For the former guideline, see [[Wikipedia:Main Page featured article protection]].
{{Clear}}{{anchor|create}}<!-- Former tag allows section referencing while accommodating section name changes. DO NOT REMOVE IT. -->

=== <span id="Creation protection"></span>Creation protection (salting) ===
[[File:Create-protection-shackle.svg|64px|upright=0.4|right|alt=Blue padlock|link=]]
{{policy shortcut|WP:SALT|WP:SKYBLUELOCK}}

Administrators can prevent the creation of pages. This level of protection is useful for bad pages that have been [[Wikipedia:Deletion policy|deleted]] but repeatedly recreated. Such protection is case-sensitive. There are several levels of creation protection that can be applied to pages, identical to the levels for edit protection. A list of protected titles may be found at [[Special:ProtectedTitles]] (see also [[WP:Protected titles/Historical|historical lists]]).

Pre-emptive restrictions on new article titles are instituted through the [[MediaWiki:Titleblacklist|title blacklist]] system, which allows for more flexible protection with support for [[substring]]s and [[regular expression]]s.

{{Anchor| Salted}}Pages that have been creation-protected are sometimes referred to as "[[salting the earth |salted]]". Contributors wishing to re-create a salted title with appropriate content should either contact an [[Wikipedia:Administrators|administrator]] (preferably the protecting administrator), file a request at [[Wikipedia:Requests for page protection#Current requests for reduction in protection level]], or use the [[Wikipedia:Deletion review|deletion review]] process. To make a convincing case for re-creation, it is helpful to show a [[WP:Drafts|draft version]] of the intended article when filing a request.

Administrators should choose the appropriate level of create protection—autoconfirmed, extended-confirmed,<ref name="ECPRFC2"/> or full. Due to the implementation of [[WP:ACPERM|ACPERM]], non-confirmed editors cannot create pages in mainspace; thus, semi-creation protection should be rare, used only for protection of pages outside of mainspace.

While creation-protection is usually permanent, temporary creation protection may be applied if a page is repeatedly recreated by a single user (or [[WP:SOCK|sockpuppets]] of that user, if applicable).

{{Clear}}{{anchor|move}}<!--former tag allows section referencing while accommodating section name changes. DO NOT REMOVE IT.-->

=== Move protection ===
[[File:Move-protection-shackle.svg|64px|upright=0.4|right|alt=Green padlock|link=]]
{{Policy shortcut|WP:MOVP|WP:GREENLOCK}}

Move protected pages, or more technically, fully move-protected pages, cannot be moved to a new title except by an administrator. Move protection is commonly applied to:

* Pages subject to persistent page-move [[Wikipedia:Vandalism|vandalism]].
* Pages subject to a page-name dispute.
* Highly visible pages that have no reason to be moved, such as the [[Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard|administrators' noticeboard]] and articles selected as "[[Wikipedia:Today's featured article|Today's featured article]]" on the main page.

Fully edit-protected pages are also implicitly move-protected.

As with full edit protection, protection because of edit warring should not be considered an endorsement of the current name. When move protection is applied during a requested move discussion, the page should be protected at the location it was at when the move request was started.

All [[WP:FILE|files]] are implicitly move-protected; only [[WP:File mover|file movers]] and administrators can rename files.

{{Clear}}{{anchor|upload}}<!--former tag allows section referencing while accommodating section name changes. DO NOT REMOVE IT.-->

=== Upload protection ===
[[File:Upload-protection-shackle.svg|64px|upright=0.4|right|alt=Purple padlock|link=]]
{{Policy shortcut|WP:UPLOAD-P|WP:PURPLELOCK}}
Upload protected files, or more technically, fully upload-protected files, cannot be replaced with new versions except by an administrator. Upload protection does not protect file pages from editing. Upload protection may be applied by an administrator to:
* Files subject to persistent upload [[Wikipedia:Vandalism|vandalism]].
* Files subject to a dispute between editors.
* Files that should not be replaced, such as images used in the interface or transcluded to the main page.
* Files with common or generic names. (eg. [[File:map.png]])

As with full edit protection, administrators should avoid favoring one file version over another, and protection should not be considered an endorsement of the current file version. An exception to this rule is when files are protected due to upload vandalism.

{{Clear}}{{anchor|pending}}{{anchor|Pending-changes protection (trial)}}{{anchor|pc1}}{{anchor|pc2}}<!--former tags allow section referencing while accommodating section name changes. DO NOT REMOVE IT.-->

=== Pending changes protection ===
{{see|Wikipedia:Pending changes}}
[[File:Pending-protection-shackle.svg|64px|upright=0.4|right|alt=White padlock|link=]]
{{Policy shortcut|WP:PCPP|WP:WHITELOCK}}

Pending changes protection is a tool used to suppress [[Wikipedia:Vandalism|vandalism]] and certain other persistent problems while allowing all users to continue to submit edits. Pending changes protection can be used as an alternative to semi-protection to allow unregistered and new users to edit pages, while keeping the edits hidden from the view of most readers until those changes are accepted by a [[WP:RPC|pending changes reviewer]].

When a page under pending changes protection is edited by an [[WP:IP|unregistered]] (IP addresses) editor or a [[Wikipedia:User access levels#New users|new user]], the edit is not directly visible to the majority of Wikipedia readers, until it is reviewed and accepted by an editor with the [[Wikipedia:User access levels#Pending changes reviewer|pending changes reviewer right]]. When a page under pending changes protection is edited by an [[Wikipedia:User access levels#Autoconfirmed users|autoconfirmed user]], the edit will be immediately visible to Wikipedia readers, unless there are pending edits waiting to be reviewed.

Pending changes are visible in the page history, where they are marked as pending review. Readers that are ''not logged in'' (the vast majority of readers) are shown the latest ''accepted'' version of the page; ''logged-in'' users see the latest version of the page, with all changes (reviewed or not) applied. When editors who are not reviewers make changes to an article with unreviewed pending changes, their edits are also marked as pending and are not visible to most readers.

A user who clicks "edit this page" is always, at that point, shown the latest version of the page for editing ''regardless of whether the user is logged in or not''.
*If the editor is not logged in, their changes join any other changes to the article awaiting review{{snd}}for the present they remain hidden from not-logged-in users. (This means that when the editor looks at the article after saving, the editor won't see the change made.)
*If the editor is logged in and a pending changes reviewer, and there are pending changes, the editor will be prompted to review the pending changes before editing{{snd}}see [[Wikipedia:Pending changes]].
*If the editor is logged in and not a pending changes reviewer, then{{nbsp}}...
**If there are no unreviewed pending edits waiting, this editor's edits will be visible to everyone immediately; but
**If there are unreviewed pending edits waiting, then this editor's edits will be visible only to other logged-in users (including themself) immediately, but not to readers not logged in.

Reviewing of pending changes should be resolved within reasonable time limits.<!-- <<what does this mean, and how does it help to say it? -->

==== When to apply pending changes protection ====
Pending changes may be used to protect articles against:
* Persistent vandalism
* Violations of the [[Wikipedia:biographies of living persons|biographies of living persons]] policy
* [[WP:CV|Copyright violations]]

Pending changes protection should not be used as a preemptive measure against violations that have not yet occurred. Like semi-protection, PC protection should '''never''' be used in genuine content disputes, where there is a risk of placing a particular group of editors (unregistered users) at a disadvantage. Pending changes protection should not be used on articles with a very high edit rate, even if they meet the aforementioned criteria. Instead semi-protection should be considered.

In addition, administrators may apply temporary pending changes protection on pages that are subject to significant but temporary vandalism or disruption (for example, due to media attention) when blocking individual users is not a feasible option. As with other forms of protection, the time frame of the protection should be proportional to the problem. Indefinite PC protection should be used only in cases of severe long-term disruption.

Removal of pending changes protection can be requested of any administrator, or at [[Wikipedia:RFUP|requests for unprotection]].

{{anchor|Reviewing}}The reviewing process is described in detail at [[Wikipedia:Reviewing pending changes]].

{{policy shortcut|WP:ECP|WP:BLUELOCK}}
Extended confirmed protection, also known as 30/500 protection, only allows edits by editors with the [[Wikipedia:User access levels#Extendedconfirmed|extended confirmed]] user access level, granted automatically to registered users with at least 30 days tenure and 500 edits.

Where semi-protection has proven to be ineffective, administrators may use extended confirmed protection to combat disruption (such as [[WP:VD|vandalism]], abusive [[WP:SOCK|sockpuppetry]], [[WP:WAR|edit wars]], etc.) on any topic. Extended confirmed protection should not be used as a preemptive measure against disruption that has not yet occurred, nor should it be used to privilege extended confirmed users over unregistered/new users in valid content disputes on articles not covered by Arbitration Committee 30/500 rulings.

As outlined in [[Meta:Office actions#Use of advanced rights by Foundation staff]], pages may be protected by [[Wikipedia:Wikimedia Foundation|Wikimedia Foundation]] staff in response to issues such as copyright infringement or libel.

[[File:Cascade-protection-shackle.svg|64px|upright=0.4|right|alt=Turquoise padlock|link=]]
{{Policy shortcut|WP:CASCADE|WP:TURQUOISELOCK}}
Cascading protection fully protects a page, and extends that full protection ''automatically'' to any page that is [[Wikipedia:Transclusion|transcluded]] onto the protected page, whether directly or indirectly. This includes templates, images and other media that are hosted on the English Wikipedia. Files stored on Commons are ''not'' protected by any other wiki's cascading protection and, if they are to be protected, must be either temporarily uploaded to the English Wikipedia or explicitly protected at Commons (whether manually or through cascading protection there). When operational, [[c:User:KrinkleBot|KrinkleBot]] cascade-protects Commons files transcluded at [[Wikipedia:Main Page/Tomorrow]], [[Wikipedia:Main Page/Commons media protection]] and [[Main Page]]. As the bot's response time varies, media should ''not'' be transcluded on the main page (or its constituent templates) until after it has been protected. (This is particularly relevant to [[Template:In the news]], for which upcoming images are not queued at [[Wikipedia:Main Page/Tomorrow]].) Cascading protection:
*Should be used only to prevent [[Wikipedia:Vandalism|vandalism]] when placed on particularly visible pages, such as the main page.
*Is available only for fully protected pages; it is disabled for lower levels of protection as it represents a security flaw. See [[Phabricator:T10796]] for more information.
*Is not instantaneous; it may be several hours before it takes effect. See [[Phabricator:T20483]] for more information.
*Should generally not be applied directly to templates or [[WP:LUA|modules]], as it will not protect transclusions inside {{tag|includeonly|o}} tags or transclusions that depend on template parameters, but ''will'' protect the [[Wikipedia:Template documentation|documentation subpage]]. See the [[#Protection of templates|"Protection of templates" section]] below for alternatives.

The list of cascading-protected pages can be found at [[Wikipedia:Cascade-protected items]]. Requests to add or remove cascading protection on a page should be made at [[Wikipedia talk:Cascade-protected items]] as an [[Wikipedia:Edit requests|edit request]].

It was [[gerrit:153302|implemented on August 10, 2014]] and used the same day to override community consensus regarding the use of the Media Viewer on the [[German Wikipedia]]'s primary site JavaScript, [[:de:MediaWiki:Common.js|common.js]]. It was never used on the English Wikipedia. On November 5, 2015, the WMF decided to [[mw:WMF product development process/2015-11-05|remove]] superprotect from all Wikimedia wikis.

Cascading semi-protection was formerly possible, but it was disabled in 2007 after [[phab:T10796|users noticed]] that non-administrators could fully protect any page by transcluding it onto the page to which cascading semi-protection had been applied by an administrator.

=== Pending changes protection level&nbsp;2 ===
{{Shortcut|WP:ORANGELOCK}}
Originally, two levels of pending changes protection existed, where level{{nbsp}}2 required edits by all users who are not [[WP:Reviewing pending changes|pending changes reviewers]] to be reviewed. Following a community discussion, level{{nbsp}}2 was retired from the English Wikipedia in January 2017. It was suggested then that "Pending changes level{{nbsp}}1" be referred to in the future as simply "Pending changes".<ref>[[Special:Permalink/762319924#Make PC2 no longer available to admins|VPR RfC to remove PC2]]</ref>

== Protection by namespace ==

=== <span id="Talk pages"></span>Article talk pages ===
{{anchor|full-talk}}<!--former tag allows section referencing while accommodating section name changes. DO NOT REMOVE IT.-->
Modifications to a protected page can be proposed on its [[Wikipedia:Talk page|talk page]] (or at another appropriate forum) for discussion. Administrators can make changes to the protected article reflecting [[Wikipedia:Consensus|consensus]]. Placing the {{tlx|Edit protected}} template on the talk page will draw the attention of administrators for implementing uncontroversial changes.

Talk pages are not usually protected, and are semi-protected only for a limited duration in the most severe cases of vandalism.

=== User talk pages ===
User talk pages are rarely protected. However, protection may be applied if there is severe vandalism or abuse. Users whose talk pages are protected may wish to have an unprotected user talk subpage linked conspicuously from their main talk page to allow good-faith comments from users that the protection restricts editing from.

A user's request to have their own talk page protected is not a sufficient rationale by itself to protect the page, although requests may be considered if a reason is provided.

==== Blocked users ====
Blocked users' user talk pages should not ordinarily be protected, as this interferes with the user's ability to contest their block through the normal process. It also prevents others from being able to use the talk page to communicate with the blocked editor.

In extreme cases of abuse by the blocked user, such as abuse of the {{tl|unblock}} template, re-blocking the user with talk page access removed should be preferred over applying protection to the page. If the user has been blocked and with the ability to edit their user talk page disabled, they should be informed of this in a block notice, subsequent notice, or message, and it should include information and instructions for appealing their block off-wiki, such as through the [[WP:UTRS|UTRS tool interface]] or, as a last recourse, [[Wikipedia:Appealing a block#Routes to unblock|the Arbitration Committee]].

When required, protection should be implemented for only a brief period, not exceeding the duration of the block.

Confirmed socks of registered users should be dealt with in accordance with [[Wikipedia:Sockpuppetry]]; their pages are not normally protected.

=== User pages ===
{{Policy shortcut|WP:UPROT|WP:UPPROT}}

Base user pages (for example, the page User:Example, and not User:Example/subpage or User talk:Example) are automatically protected from creation or editing by unconfirmed accounts and anonymous IP users. An exception to this includes an unconfirmed registered account attempting to create or edit their own user page. IP editors and unconfirmed accounts are also unable to create or edit user pages that do not belong to a currently-registered account. This protection is enforced by [[Special:AbuseFilter/803|an edit filter]].<ref>Please refer to [[Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Protect user pages by default]] and [[Wikipedia talk:Requests for comment/Protect user pages by default|its talk page]] for community discussion related to a preventative measure for user pages.</ref> Users may opt-out of this protection by placing {{tlx|unlocked userpage}} anywhere on their own user page.

[[Wikipedia:User pages|User pages]] and subpages within their own user space may be protected upon a request from the user, as long as a need exists. Pages within the user space should not be automatically or pre-emptively protected without good reason or cause.<ref>Per discussion at [[Wikipedia talk:Protection policy/Archive 15#Own userspace pages protection policy]], June 2013</ref><ref>Per discussion at [[Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Archive314#Protecting an editor's user page or user space per their request]], September 2019</ref> Requests for protection specifically at uncommon levels (such as template protection<!--ArbCom 30/500 protection should possibly be mentioned here too-->) may be granted if the user has expressed a genuine and realistic need.

When a filter is insufficient to stop user page vandalism, a user may choose to create a ".css" subpage (ex. User:Example/Userpage.css), copy all the contents of their user page onto the subpage, transclude the subpage by putting {{tlf|User:Example/Userpage.css}} on their user page, and then ask an administrator to fully protect their user page. Because user space pages that end in ".css", ".js", and ".json" are editable only by the user to which that user space belongs (and interface administrators), this will protect your user page from further vandalism.

==== Deceased users ====
{{See also|Wikipedia:Deceased Wikipedians/Guidelines}}

In the event of the confirmed death of a user, the user's user page (but not the user talk page) should be fully protected.

=== Protection of templates ===
{{shortcut|WP:PTPROT}}
{{see also|Wikipedia:High-risk templates|Wikipedia:Template documentation}}
Highly visible templates, which are used on an extremely large number of pages or substituted with great frequency, are often semi-, template-, or fully-protected based on the degree of visibility, type of use, content, etc.

Protected templates should normally have the {{tl|documentation}} template. It loads the unprotected <code>/doc</code> page, so that non-admins and IP-users can edit the documentation, categories and interwiki links. It also automatically adds {{tl|pp-template}} to protected templates, which displays a small padlock in the top right corner and categorizes the template as protected. Only manually add {{tlf|pp-template}} to protected templates that don't use {{tlf|documentation}} (mostly the flag templates).

Cascading protection should generally not be applied directly to templates, as it will not protect transclusions inside {{tag|includeonly|o}} tags or transclusions that depend on template parameters, but ''will'' protect the template's [[Wikipedia:Template documentation|documentation subpage]]. Instead, consider any of the following:
* If the set of subtemplates is static (even if large), protect them using normal protection mechanisms.
* If the set of subtemplates is unbounded, use [[MediaWiki:Titleblacklist]] to protect all subtemplates using a particular naming format (as is done for [[WP:Editnotice|editnotice templates]] and subtemplates of [[Template:TFA title]]).

Note: All [[WP:Editnotice|editnotice templates]] (except those in userspace) are already protected via [[MediaWiki:Titleblacklist]]. They can be edited by admins, [[WP:Template editor|template editors]] and [[WP:Page mover|page movers]] only.

=== Sandboxes ===
{{see also|Wikipedia:About the Sandbox}}

Sandboxes should not ordinarily be protected since their purpose is to let new users test and experiment with [[Help:wiki markup|wiki syntax]]. Most sandboxes are automatically cleaned every 12 hours, although they are frequently overwritten by other testing users. The [[Wikipedia:Sandbox]] is cleaned every hour. Those who use sandboxes for malicious purposes, or to violate policies such as [[Wikipedia:no personal attacks|no personal attacks]], [[Wikipedia:civility|civility]], or [[Wikipedia:Copyrights|copyrights]], should instead be warned and/or blocked.

== Available templates ==

The following templates may be added at the very top of a page to indicate that it is protected:

{{Protection templates}}

On redirect pages, use the {{tl|Redirect category shell}} template, which automatically categorizes by protection level, below the redirect line. A protection template may also be added below the redirect line, but it will serve only to categorize the page, as it will not be visible on the page, and it will have to be manually removed when protection is removed.
